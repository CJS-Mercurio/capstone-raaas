The purpose of this study is to propose and assess the level of E-service in terms of E-service satisfaction and E-service loyalty. In order to fully determine the impact of E-services, a total of 400 respondents in P.U.P campuses of Taguig and Parañaque were surveyed. The results indicate that all the dimensions of E-service quality were found to have positive and significant effect on E-service satisfaction and E-service loyalty of online shoppers. The assessment revealed that females are more willing to tell their satisfaction and loyalty level concerning to E-service. In addition, age groups of 18-20 use E-services more frequently rather that the other age groups mostly in Generation Z. With these findings, researchers made recommendations.

High temperature is a common factor affecting the plant development process and growth. Therefore, the temperature should be maintained at the required temperature level whenever possible. The easiest way to get started in greenhouse vegetable production is to use the existing soil on site, but soils must be well drained. Soil water serves as a solvent and carrier of food nutrients for plant growth but overwatering the plant could cause drowning and rotting of the roots. This could happen with gardeners who manually water their plant in traditional greenhouse. To avoid excessive moisture, it is therefore important to monitor the moisture levels of the soil to make sure that there is enough water in the plant depending on its requirements. Another factor affecting plant growths is high humidity which causes fungal diseases most likely to spread and develop. It is therefore important to make sure that air is circulating through the greenhouse to reduce the water vapor around the plants. Insects can become pests in the garden when they cause damage to garden plants. The signs of damage vary, typically depending on the way that the insect feeds on the plant. They can gain entrance into the greenhouse through vents, doorways, openings in the greenhouse, and even on clothing and equipment. When not properly controlled, it could cause ragged chewed leaf edges or holes in leaves, defoliation, or stem and fruit tunneling.

Since its\r\ninstallation, the LIS has allowed the Department to generate the total public school enrolment\r\nbased on the actual registration of learners.\r\nThe LIS is an innovative tool that the Department uses to manage information with the aim \r\npromoting transparency, informed decision making, and empowerment at different levels of the\r\norganization. While being a tech-based solution, the LIS involves an inclusive, community-driven\r\nprocess that thrives because of the active engagement and participation of all teachers, principals,\r\nplanning officers and other DepEd personnel all throughout the Philippines.\r\nAccording to Secretary Br. Armin A. Luistro, FSC, â€œConsidering the size of the Department and\r\nthe number schools under it, it is very critical for the Agency to be equipped with the right\r\ninformation at the right time to be able to make better decisions. This is essentially an online\r\nregistry of learners that is important for any educational system or institution. We need to\r\ncontinually get to know our learners better so that we can respond better.\r\nOut of the 46,648 public schools in the country, only 140 (0.3%) schools have failed to submit\r\ndata for SY 2014-2015, which demonstrates a very high participation and submission rate by the\r\nschools. The concerned divisions have already been instructed to complete the remaining school\r\ninformation immediately.\r\nThis system is envisioned to allow the Department to better track its learners in both formal and\r\nnon-formal instruction so that more appropriate interventions can be formulated in the provision of quality education for all Filipino learners. As an example, students who transfer from one school\r\nto another can be monitored and better assisted by using data from the LIS.\r\nThe use of automation and technology has helped the Department update information on\r\nenrollment for planning, budgeting and resource allocation among others. Luistro added that,\r\nâ€œWhat used to take ten months to collect, consolidate and validate has now been reduced to three\r\nmonths.

In this type of teaching style, sooner or later, if the students finally enter the competitive world, the students will apply all those skills they have acquired from their teachers and from  university.

Teaching competencies are the ability of a teacher or a professor that contributes to the studentâ€™s departure process.  This skill includes knowledge, skills, attitudes, experiences, which is to be the target category of the profession of educator.

So, the teachers or the professors must be ready when dealing with these type of students because they are too shallow, even when they are told to do a thing in a right way, they will get hurt, because they think that they made a mistake, but if the professor has the proper skills in dealing with this type of students, they will tend to be more positive and be focused on every task theyâ€™re assigned to do._x000D_\r\n	For the student who tends to be easy go lucky, the professors or teachers must have the eagerness to divert the minds of this type of people to give more attention in studying, that being an easy go lucky person will not lead them to success but will lead them to failures.

Choosing a perfect job once youâ€™ve graduated is one of the\r\nproblems being faced by graduating students today. The biggest decision of a\r\ngraduating student would make is choosing which path of work industry they will go. It\r\nmay be hard for the graduating students because choosing a job will determine their\r\nfuture career. The choices they have is working in the field that is related to what they\r\nstudied for years or to where they are interested or choosing jobs that is available. Of\r\ncourse, itâ€™s not really easy to get a job that you want since thereâ€™s a lot of a qualification\r\nto pass. And with that reason, most of the graduates bust their buns getting an\r\neducation, but end up with positions that donâ€™t require a degree or challenge them.\r\nBachelor of Science in Office Administration (BSOA) is a course designed to\r\nprovide student with knowledge and skills in different workplaces such as general\r\nbusiness and legal offices. Students with this course were trained to develop their skills\r\nin keyboarding, filling, shorthand or stenography, secretarial duties, and management.\r\nBSOA is course that has many opportunities that is why students who graduated with\r\nthese courses often found in different fields.

The home is where family lives, but when we say ?house? it is referring to a material structure, while ?home? refers to things that family member bind together. Family is none of the essential factor for the humanâ€™s whole-being, behavior are relying on the structure of the family. Unity is the so desire of every family in the society today; but the issue of broken home is on the high side in most of our societies today. There are so many factors responsible for the rate of broken homes in our society today; the major concern of this research work is to examine how this affects the behavior of children. The ongoing pressure on the children can equally affect them negatively; because these children are lacking proper parental guides from both parents. Morally and emotionally the children are affected.  Another point to note here is the death of one of the parents; especially if the surviving parent is the mother; mothers are mostly know for giving care to the children; at times financial assistance as well but this is not always coming through;  because mothers can actually assist to some extent financially. \r\n \r\nThe children began to learn how to survive on their own; some end up meeting the wrong people; at the end of the day they might become cultist, thieves etc. all these are social vices in the community. At a point in time you can easily identify such children by the way they behave, interact and relate with others in the society. Parents have a major role to play on the behavioral pattern of children in the society, because the first education starts from home. The effort of parents in the upbringing of their children is the reflection of what people see in their children outside their various homes. Child development/ behavior can be affected by a number of things, but a big factor may be the parents. Depending on the severity of a broken home, the parentâ€™s relationship with each other, as well as their children, can affect how their children behave and may even develop. \r\nThis doesnâ€™t mean that a parentâ€™s divorce can make it so a child can never climb steps or hop on one foot, but it can make it harder for children to develop social skills and may even set back their achievements. Depending on a childâ€™s age, the separation of their parents may cause extreme stress and, in the worst case, even depression. However, keeping the parentâ€™s married might not be in the best interest either, depending on the familyâ€™s situation. In my experience of coming from a broken home, I have never suffered from developmental or behavioral problems. Parents have an impact on their children, married or not. However, on average, broken homes have a significant impact on children and may even continue throughout their life. (Amato, 2005) \r\nLastly, there are three types of behavior that parents should understand when it comes to their children. First, there is a behavior that is approved. This includes behavior such as being kind to other people, being understanding, and listening to others. The second type of behavior is one that is not necessarily wanted at all times but is tolerated. This behavior can be caused by the child being stressed or sick and is understood in context, and, depending on the family, different types of behavior are tolerated. The last type of behavior is one that should not be tolerated. This type can be troublesome for a childâ€™s intellectual development and may even cause harm to the ?physical, emotional, or social well-being of the child? (Normal Child Behavior, 2015). This type of behavior can also be caused by the parent, depending on how they act emotionally. Children may start to copy their parentâ€™s behavior because of how closely they follow them for the normal emotional reactions of society. This may get troublesome, depending if the parent is aggressive and acting upon anger. In this case, when a child starts to mimic their parent, they develop the third type of behavior. The children that have an experienced in having a broken family are more likely to have in early sexual activities, aggressiveness, anxiety, developmental disorder, absences from school, bad habits, attention-seeking behavior, social difficulties, and had great difficulties in school. Broken family can negatively affect the childâ€™s development', NULL, '2017-2018', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 3, NULL, NULL, 12, NULL, 6, 'surTmFRDitHb', 0, 0, '2021-08-13 00:55:51', '2021-09-08 09:17:46', NULL),

Section 512 removes liability for copyright infringement from websites that allow users to post content, as long as the site has a mechanism in place whereby the copyright owner can request removal of the infringing content. The site must also not receive a financial benefit directly ascribable to the infringing activity.  According to Mr. Ahmed andQazi â€œWe donâ€™t have a choice on whether we do social media; the question is how well we do it.â€  Usage of Social Media is important among all ages. It creates an impact not only on the marketing aspect but also amongst the lives of the people: connecting and building relationships, a platform to showcase their situation, source of daily news or a way to build-up their self-esteem.Correspondingly, Section 230 Communications Decency Act protects websites from definite liability evolving from the publication of information given by another. This usually emerges in the context of defamation, privacy, negligence and other tort claims. It does not nevertheless, cover criminal liabilitym copyright infringement or other intellectual property claims. \r\nSocial Media usersdont enjoy any of the privileges granted to social networking sites under the law, so they must be careful to always act appropriately when posting messages of files to the sites. The main sector where users can get themselves into trouble are through the posting of libelous content of content that violates the intellectual property rights.\r\n	As observed on the youth nowadays most of their time is invested on social media and where they invest our time creates an impact and influence in our daily lives. The study focuses on the relationship of the studentsâ€™ usage of Social Media to their academic performance. \r\nEverybody can use social media as young as 3 years old. Fortunately, social media is convenient to everybody.  People can easily browse on the internet anytime and anywhere, what they wanted to know about. \r\nThe researcher study aims to examine how the studentâ€™s usage of social media impacts effect on their academic performance. The term is defined as the amount of something that is used. The researcher study will not only measure but also determine how usage of social media can affect the studentsâ€™ academic performance and identify what factors which factors contribute to such negative or positive effects. \r\n           The use of social media has been characterized over a large area or number of people. It is mainly used by millions of people especially by youths today. According to the researcher many people find out that the Internet could be used to connect with other people in an easiest way of communication, whether for business or commercial purpose, make new friends, or find their old friends and long-lost relatives. In relation to this study, there is no doubt that the usage of social media has given us a lot of factors in terms of how we communicate to one and another even without face-to-face interaction whether you are in near or far places.\r\nThe researchers synthesize that in today\'s generation, they overused the social media that would lead them to addiction. Some students missed doing their homeworkâ€™s and other school works because after school, they first logged in and browse their Facebook, twitter, and other social networking sites rather than working up their school work nor reviewing their notes right after they got home from school. This networking sites affects their study time that distracts their academic performance. These sites noticed have a lot of positive effects, but they also have their share of negative impact. On the point of academic performance or excellence, Tuckman (1975) posited that, performance is used to label the observable manifestation of knowledge, skills, concepts, and understanding and ideas. \r\nIn educational institutions, success is measured by how you perform in school, or how well a studentâ€™s meets the minimum requirement that has given by organization or institutions itself.  As the process of trying to succeed after you have finished your degree course grows showing a lot of strong emotion in the working world, the quality work of students doing well in school has caught the interest of parents, teacher or professor in the same way.  \r\nArmstrong(2012), Students began to rely on accessibility of information that is available on the social mediaâ€.

The researchers chose to study work-life balance because it was already been a concern of employees in the society.  In terms of job satisfaction, the researchers chose this factor because it is every workersâ€™ sense of achievement and success on the job. \nThe goal of this study was reached by using descriptive design involving 33 males and 81 females.  The findings of this study showed that majority of the respondents are females with a percentage of 71.1 % and 50% of them are ranging in the age of 20-30 years old with a single civil status and are rendering their service from 2-5 years.  Under work-life balance, the respondents strongly agreed that there is a clear boundary between their work and family which got the highest weighted mean of 3.31. Overall, the respondents perceive their work-life balance to be agreeable in a good situation with a  grand mean of 2.7768.  On the other side, job satisfaction of legal practitioners under Maintenance factors got a grand mean of 3.1114 with a â€˜Satisfiedâ€™ level of interpretation.  Another one, legal practitioners are still satisfied under the Motivational factors with a grand mean of 3.1939.  Through the use of Pearson-R, it is being determined that work-life balance and job satisfaction has a significant relationship with each other but they are having a weak or low correlation with an R-value of 0.256. Thus, the researchers rejected the hypothesis.  \nTogether with these findings, the study concluded that most of the respondents are newbies in the court system and that a legal practitioner with a single civil status is having more time in focusing with their work and personal responsibilities.  The study also concluded that the legal practitioners of MTC and RTC in Paranaque and Taguig City perceived that there is a clear boundary between work and family/personal responsibilities. Moreover, the study concluded that  the institution of RTC and MTC branches in Paranaque and Taguig City provide a Satisfactory level in terms of every employeesâ€™ job satisfaction. It is also mentioned before that legal practitionersâ€™ perception to their work-life balance has a significant relationship with the level of their job satisfaction.  It means that a legal practitioner practicing a good work-life balance can increase the level of their job satisfaction.  \nThrough these conclusions, the study recommended that MTC and RTC  branches should provide a work-life balance policies for their employees like No Work, No Call Policy, Job Sharing, flexible working schedules, conduct leisure activities, and provide an evaluation system quarterly for each legal practitioners.  On the part of the legal practitioners, the study also recommended them to build a healthy lifestyle by means of making choices to cultivate healthy habits and limit time wasting activities.

Research questions are answered by interpreting the answers from the survey gathered from the respondents thru online and meet-ups.  Purposive sampling technique was the method that was used to select samples from the different strata of the population for this research.  The respondents were divided according to the year they graduated.  Frequency and percentage was used to identify the characteristic of a given tabulated data.  Weighted mean was used to determine the group norms of respondents and various factors considered in the study. T-test was used to know the significance of the difference between Two Means for independent samples.  Lastly, One-way ANOVA was used to describe the analysis of variance as a statistical tool employed to test for the significance of the difference between more than two sample means.\r\n\r\n	Based on the respondents, findings revealed that majority of the respondents are: female, age ranges from 21 to 25, single, graduated on academic year 2013-2014, court stenographer was their job preference, legal secretary was their first job, and their current job is court stenographer.  When it comes to employability profile of the graduates, findings revealed that most of the respondents are: permanently employed in private companies, take them one to three months to get their first job as walk-in applicant, noted that the competencies they learned most in college are their communication skills, and stated that their school training is the number one factor on how they get their present job.  In the terms of the respondentsâ€™ perception regarding school related factors, it was agreed by the respondents that: the curriculum is highly relevant, the facilities, tools, and equipment are moderately adequate, they strongly agreed that the teachers are competent, and stated that on-the-job training is relevant.  \r\n	Lastly, the findings revealed that when they are grouped by Job Preference, there is a significant difference in the perception of respondents in Adequacy of the Facilities, Tools, and Equipment, while there is no significant difference on their perception in Relevance of the Curriculum, Competence of the Teacher, and On-the-job Training.  When they are grouped by First Job, the results show that there is no significant difference in their perception on the school related factors considered in this study.  When they are grouped by Current Job, the findings revealed that there is a significant difference in the perception of the respondents on the school related factors considered in this study.  When they grouped by their Present Employment Status and Kind of Employment Status, the findings revealed that there is a significant difference in the perception of the respondents on the school related factors considered in this study except in On-the-job Training factor.  Lastly, when they are grouped by the Type of Employment, the results show that there is no significant difference on the perception of the respondents in terms of the school related factors considered. \r\n\r\n	On this basis, it is recommended that the university should provide the students, specially the BSOA students, appropriate tools and equipment that are needed to boost their stenographic and typing skills that are necessary to their course.  Professors should identify the specific learning needs for the students and develop a growth plan for it.  The university should identify the current offerings and opportunities for the students.  The researchers recommend the university to set identity and standards on the specific jobs together with the required skills of the BSOA graduates in the industry.

In addition, this study is seeking for advancement, other methods for the curriculum to be enhanced, and to avoid the repetition of the problems they have encountered. The second respondent would be their acting supervisor inside their internship station for them to adapt the unending enhancement of the curriculum. This study came up with this study because it is the same with this studyâ€™ course and because of some problems that they had encountered during their On-the-Job Training.\nThis study hoped that the curriculum will be enhanced with the use of this study. This study was developed by using descriptive design with the total of 125 respondents including 27 students from PUP-T and 98 students at PUP-Sta, Mesa who were currently taking On-the-Job Training. This study believed that there is no significant difference between the assessment of On-the-Job Training when grouped according to the demographic profile of the respondents.\nThis study helped the BSOA students to understand and to be aware about the assessment of the On-the-Job Training program. It also helped them to improve their skills in becoming a professional. This is not just beneficial to the BSOA students, but also beneficial to the administration of the University including the practicum adviser and as well as to the curriculum itself because as the time passed by, there are a lot of factors that impacts the On-the-Job Training curriculum if we are going to stick to the old culture and curriculum of the On-the-Job Training Program. \nThe findings of this study showed that most of the students strongly agree on the perception of their On-the-Job Training in terms of work ethics (3.47) and also how they deal with their supervisor with courtesy (3.65). They also agree in terms of their character and appearance that they were report to work neatly and well-groomed (3.61) and that they always possessed emotional maturity (3.35). In terms of the collaborating company, the students strongly agree that their training was conductive to learning (3.47) and they were required to render overtime at the expense of the academic schedule (2.60). But in terms of the problem that they have encountered, they agree that having a high cost of transportation rate (2.54) was one of the problems that they usually encountered. However, it was not a factor that they are unable to cope-up with the requirements of the practicum (1.95). \nIn line with these findings, this study concluded that the students who are currently taking the On-the-Job Training program were properly taught to be well-groomed and neat inside their training stations. They also conclude that the collaborating company of the university are lacking in providing the desired training station to the student and it resulted the respondent to give them satisfactory rating in terms of the condition of the facility, overtime, allowance, giving free meals, gives recognition, rewards, and etc. One of the main problems that this study had concluded was that the respondents are having a conflict in their schedule in terms of On-the-Job Training vs. academic schedule. And that the practicum coordinator should consider the location of the student and its assigned training station. It is beneficial to the both parties because if the student will come on-time, they would become a big help to the company and as well as to the university, they will be recognized because of the punctuality of their students. \n', NULL, '2018-2019', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 3, NULL, NULL, 9, NULL, 6, 'GFQwjD4emE7o', 0, 0, '2021-08-13 01:00:10', '2021-08-13 16:30:10', NULL),

In addition, the system gives accurate reports regarding the inventories of dental supplies and speeds up the current operation of the dental and medical department. The primary objective in creating the PUPT Dental Management System is to help the school dentist to organize the patient’s records. This helps to easily record, delete or alter a patient’s personal information and dental records, as well as appointments of the dentist. This project aims to serve as one of the innovative systems and research in PUP with greater reliance on technology which is one of the goals and objectives of the College of Computer and Information Sciences. The following points of the current system should be automated. Patient dental records/service history, scheduling of appointments, Medicine Inventory, Supply Inventory, Managing website pages. Based on the data and processes that the researchers have gathered, the system will be used by the Dental clinic as a Patient and Dental Supply Monitoring System. This system will handle all the patient’s dental records, service history, appointments, inventory of medicine and supply, and all the transactions made by the organization.
